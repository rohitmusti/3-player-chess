## 3 Person Chess

I've always wanted to explore three person chess but have never bought a board (they're a bit expensive and take up a lot of space). Instead of investing in a physical one, I thought I'd try and make a digital one! Here is the [example ruleset](https://www.ymimports.com/pages/how-to-play-three-player-chess). Another [ruleset](https://greenchess.net/rules.php?v=three-player).

## Base Game

[x] create pieces class

[x] create board class

[x] visualize board

[x] label squares

[x] initiate board with correct pieces on correct squares

[ ] define piece movement

- determine whether other pieces are in the way

- rules about taking other people's pieces vs your own pieces

[ ] create rules for taking pieces

[ ] create system for taking turns

- you can't move other teams piece on your turn

- you can't enter invalid movement strings to text field

- if someone is eliminated, skip their turn

[ ] define rules about pawns reaching another teams "base"

[ ] define rules about what happens to the dead teams pieces (are they removed, do you assume control of them, or do they stay on and can be taken like regular pieces)

[ ] define rules about how you can move when you are in check

## Extras

[ ] create system so that you can connect multiple computers to same game

[ ] create system for being able to play multiple games at once

- this will probably start out as a link system

[ ] create way of showing what moves are available to a given piece

[ ] create drag and drop method of moving pieces

[ ] make this playable on mobile

[ ] create a leaderboard

- keep link system, maybe just allow people to define a username they want to use

- we could also make this a full blown account system

[ ] in game chat system
