## 3 Person Chess

I've always wanted to explore three person chess but have never bought a board (they're a bit expensive and take up a lot of space). Instead of investing in a physical one, I thought I'd try and make a digital one! Here is the [example ruleset](https://www.ymimports.com/pages/how-to-play-three-player-chess).

## TODOs

[x] create pieces class
[x] create board class
[x] initiate board with correct pieces on correct squares
[ ] define piece movement

    [ ] determine whether other pieces are in the way
    [ ] rules about taking other people's pieces vs your own pieces

[ ] create rules for taking pieces
[ ] create system for taking turns

    [ ] you can't move other teams piece on your turn
    [ ] if someone is eliminated, skip their turn

[ ] define rules about pawns reaching another teams "base"
[ ] define rules about what happens to the dead teams pieces
[ ] define rules about how you can move when you are in check

## Extras

[ ] create way of showing what moves are available to a given piece
[ ] create drag and drop method of moving pieces
